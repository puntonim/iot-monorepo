/* TEMPEH INCUBATOR: RELAY, BULB, DISPLAY
 * ======================================
 * A *basic* tempeh incubator:
 *  a. it has a relay to switch an incandescent bulb (60W AC), used as heating
 *      element
 *  b. it keeps the bulb ON for a period of LESS THAN 10 mins consecutive
 *  c. it keeps the bulb OFF for a period of AT LEAST 5 mins consecutive
 * Note: b. and c. are needed only because I am still testing the relay: it
 *  supports a big load (30A at 220V AC), however I want to be extra careful
 *  and make sure it doesn't heat up too much. Once I am confident, I will
 *  remove b. and c..
 *
 * The *basic* tempeh incubator is built with:
 *  - inside a hoven, with the door ajar, but partially closed by a kitchen
 *     towel such that the open space (where air is coming out) is
 *     about 3x1 cm:
 *    - feet blanket heater AC, always on at max level 6/6, connected to a wall
 *       socket;
 *    - incandescent bulb 60W AC connected to a wall socket and to the relay
 *       controlled by Arduino;
 *    - kitchen towel soaked in water, to keep himidity high;
 *  - outside the hove:
 *    - arduino with all the electronic components described here;
 *  - it's winter and the room T is ~10-13Â°C and humidity 60%.
 *
 * Display: show the temperatures and humidity detected by sensors.
 * Rotary encoders buttons: switch on the display. Note: we don't really need
 *  rotary encoders, a regular button would work too, but that's what I have
 *  wired ATM so I am reusing it.
 *
 * Devices:
 *  1xSHT-85: thermometer and hygrometer sensor.
 *  1xDS18B20: thermometer sensor.
 *  2x rotary encoder: to switch on the display. Note: we don't really need
 *   rotary encoders, a regular button would work too, but that's what I have
 *   wired ATM so I am reusing it.
 *  1x display I2C 16x2.
 *  1x relay Seeed Studio Grove SPDT 30A 250V AC: to control an incandescent
 *   bulb (60W AC).
